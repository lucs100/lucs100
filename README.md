Hey, I’m Lucas Di Pietro! I’m interested in robotics, computer science, and engineering. I'm currently in my fourth year of **Honours** [**Mechatronics Engineering**](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/mechatronics-engineering) at the University of Waterloo, on exchange at the University of Technology, Sydney.

Check out some of my projects down below! **Python** is my favourite language but I've got plenty of experience in embedded development, webdev, mathematics projects, and electronics as a whole. There's plenty of projects that are a work-in-progress or haven't left my ideas folder yet, so while I try to keep my work on here complete I'd love to talk to you about what's coming down the pipe :)

Thanks for visiting!! (＠＾◡＾)
