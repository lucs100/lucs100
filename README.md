Hi, I’m @lucs100! I’m interested in robotics, computer science, and engineering.
I'm currently pursuing a degree in **Mechatronics Engineering** at the University of Waterloo.
I’m a huge fan of the Python language, and even though this can be a problem when learning new ones, I enjoy other languages such as JS and Lua.
Most of my projects on here are personal projects done to help me learn about different aspects and principles of programming, APIs, computer science in general.
Thanks for checking out my page!
