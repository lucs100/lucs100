Hi, I’m Lucas Di Pietro! I’m interested in robotics, computer science, and engineering.
I'm currently pursuing a BaSC in **Applied Science, Honours** [**Mechatronics Engineering**](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/mechatronics-engineering) at the University of Waterloo.
I mostly write my projects in Python, but enjoy other languages such as C++, JS, and Lua.
Most of my projects on here are personal projects for learning purposes here, but I like to upload anything I've worked on as a portfolio of sorts.
Thanks for checking out my page :D
