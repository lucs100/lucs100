Hey, I’m Lucas Di Pietro! I’m interested in robotics, computer science, and engineering.
I'm currently pursuing a BaSC in **Honours** [**Mechatronics Engineering**](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/mechatronics-engineering) at the University of Waterloo.
Check out some of my projects down below! While **Python** is my favourite language, I'm not monolingual in code - I love to learn new languages by doing, and my profile is a portfolio of experimentation.
Thanks for checking out my page (＠＾◡＾)
