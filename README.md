Hi, I’m Lucas Di Pietro! I’m interested in robotics, computer science, and engineering.
I'm currently pursuing a BaSC in **Applied Science, Honours** [**Mechatronics Engineering**](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/mechatronics-engineering) at the University of Waterloo.
I mostly write my projects in Python, and even though this can be a problem when learning new languages, I enjoy other ones such as JS and Lua.
Most of my projects on here are personal projects done to help me learn about different aspects and principles of programming, interacting with APIs, and computer science in general.
Thanks for checking out my page :D
