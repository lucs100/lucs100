Hey, I’m Lucas Di Pietro! I’m interested in robotics, computer science, and engineering.
I'm currently pursuing a BaSC in **Honours** [**Mechatronics Engineering**](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/mechatronics-engineering) at the University of Waterloo, on exchange at the University of Technology, Sydney. 
Check out some of my projects down below! **Python** is my favourite language but I've got plenty of experience in embedded development, webdev, mathematics projects, and electronics as a whole. 
Thanks for checking out my page (＠＾◡＾)
