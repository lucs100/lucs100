Hey, I’m Lucas Di Pietro! I’m interested in robotics, computer science, and engineering. I'm currently in my fourth year of **Honours** [**Mechatronics Engineering**](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/mechatronics-engineering) at the University of Waterloo, working on co-op at [Actemium](https://www.actemium.ca/) as an Automation Specialist.

Check out some of my projects down below! **Python** is my favourite language but I've got plenty of experience in embedded development, webdev, mathematics projects, and electronics as a whole. There's plenty of projects that haven't made it on here, are a work-in-progress, or just haven't left my ideas folder yet, so while I try to keep my work on here complete I'd love to speak to you about what's coming soon :)

Thanks for visiting!! (＠＾◡＾)
