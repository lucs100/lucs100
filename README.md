Hi, I’m Lucas Di Pietro! I’m interested in robotics, computer science, and engineering.
I'm currently pursuing a BaSC in **Honours** [**Mechatronics Engineering**](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/mechatronics-engineering) at the University of Waterloo.
I'm proficient in Python and you'll see a lot of my projects written using it, but I'm skilled with other languages, like C++, Java, and JS.
Some of my projects on here are personal projects I've done to practice new languages or concepts - I like to upload anything I've worked on as a portfolio of sorts.
Thanks for checking out my page :D
